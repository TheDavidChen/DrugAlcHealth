# DrugAlcHealth

In this project, we use classical regression models and supervised learning methods to link health expenditure by state and state census data to drug overdose deaths and/or alcohol-impaired driving deaths. In exploring this relationship, we seek to understand whether the amount of funds invested in the health of citizens plays a role in preventing deaths from drugs and make recommendations on whether states which see more drug deaths should consider increasing health expenditures.
